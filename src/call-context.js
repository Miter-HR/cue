// call-context.js — sales / customer-call awareness for cue.
//
// Replaces the interview category detector. Reads the last few "Them" turns
// (the prospect or customer) and classifies what kind of moment the rep is in,
// then produces two things main.js uses:
//   1. a short playbook block for the system prompt (how to handle this moment)
//   2. retrieval hints — extra terms appended to the knowledge-base query so
//      the matching Slite playbook (discovery questions, kickoff process,
//      customer references, competitor discovery, assets) ranks first.
//
// Pure functions, no Electron.
